# Simon Says Game
Final project for the Altice Mobile Developer Certification.

The game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons.
As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

This project uses [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) to help with the data persistance by saving a json into the Shared Preferences.
